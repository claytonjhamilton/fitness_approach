\section{Self-Myofascial Release (SMR) - Once Daily}

A systematic review found that SMR may reduce perceived pain after 
intense exercise and improve joint range of motion.\cite{pmid26618062} Further, a small study found that
 emphasizing static pressure on myofascial trigger points during each session may help resolve muscle impairments.\cite{pmid30765920} 
 \\
 \\
Time to complete: ~9 minutes

\subsection{Foam Roller}

For each of the following perform 10 complete rolls (1 roll = top to bottom to top). Emphasize static pressure on trigger points.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Upper Back
    \item Latissimus Dorsi
    \item Gluteus Maximus \\ Place ankle on knee; roll one side at a time
    \item Hip Flexors
    \item IT band
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Ball}
Place ball on floor and roll out the following with 10 complete rolls per side. Emphasize static pressure on trigger points.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pectoral Release \\ Lie on stomach, cross one arm behind back, and roll armpit to sternum on that side
    \item Scapular Release \\ Lie on back, cross arms over chest, and roll along medial border of scapula
